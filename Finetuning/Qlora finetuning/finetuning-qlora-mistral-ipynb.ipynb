notebook that goes through the recent `bitsandbytes` integration that includes the work from XXX that introduces no performance degradation 4bit quantization techniques, for democratizing LLMs inference and training.\n\nIn this notebook, we will learn together how to load a large model in 4bit (`gpt-neo-x-20b`) and train it using Google Colab and PEFT library from Hugging Face 🤗.\n\n[In the general usage notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ge2F1QSK8Q7h0hn3YKuBCOAS0bK8E0wf?usp=sharing), you can learn how to propely load a model in 4bit with all its variants.\n\nIf you liked the previous work for integrating [*LLM.int8*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339), you can have a look at the [introduction blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration) to lean
