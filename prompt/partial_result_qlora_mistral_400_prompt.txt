All things considered
		overall accuracy: 
		0.605
		confusion matrix: 
		correct forward 242 wrong forward 158 correct backward 224 wrong_backward 176
This is to say
		overall accuracy: 
		0.7075
		confusion matrix: 
		correct forward 283 wrong forward 117 correct backward 252 wrong_backward 148
...
		0.65
		confusion matrix: 
		correct forward 260 wrong forward 140 correct backward 227 wrong_backward 173
That is to put it mildly
		overall accuracy: 
		0.6525
		confusion matrix: 
		correct forward 261 wrong forward 139 correct backward 241 wrong_backward 159
Let's face
		overall accuracy: 
		0.665
		confusion matrix: 
		correct forward 266 wrong forward 134 correct backward 235 wrong_backward 165
Essentially speaking 
		overall accuracy: 
		0.6725
		confusion matrix: 
		correct forward 269 wrong forward 131 correct backward 241 wrong_backward 159
So to speak 
		overall accuracy: 
		0.66
		confusion matrix: 
		correct forward 264 wrong forward 136 correct backward 239 wrong_backward 161
=>
		overall accuracy: 
		0.6775
		confusion matrix: 
		correct forward 271 wrong forward 129 correct backward 244 wrong_backward 156
